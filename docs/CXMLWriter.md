 When the test is run, an instance of the CXMLWriter is creaTed through the constructor in SImplementation.
 
WriteEntity method is called on the newly created instance and it checks the type of XML entity and calls the necessary handler (start, end, char)

These handlers write the XML elements and the character data to the buffer. This is where the flashbuffer method may be called to write the buffers content to the sink.

After the writing operations, the test code may include assertions using EXPECT_XXX macros to check if the expected results match the actual results.
Test Teardown:

After each test, the Google Test framework performs any necessary cleanup, and if applicable, the destructor CXMLWriter::~CXMLWriter() is called.
CXMLWriter Destructor:

If the CXMLWriter instance is destroyed (e.g., after the test case or when the test program exits), the CXMLWriter destructor is called.
Test Result:
